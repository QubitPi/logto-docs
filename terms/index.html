<p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented various security measures to protect it, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Secure Communication: The communication between any public party to Logto services is enforced by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLS</a> (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between you and our service is encrypted and secure.</li>
<li>Private Database Network: The Logto database stays in a private network in the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure West Europe region</a>, with no direct access to the public internet. This ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.</li>
<li>Data Isolation: Every tenant has a dedicated database role and every business table has enforced <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Row-Level Security</a> to ensure that your data is isolated in the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant&#x27;s data is separated from other tenants.</li>
<li>Password Encryption: Logto will not store passwords in plain text. All passwords are encrypted using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argon2</a> algorithm, which is a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even if a data breach were to occur, your password would not be compromised.</li>
<li>Database Encryption: All data stored in the Logto database is encrypted at rest. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-security#information-protection-and-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information protection and encryption</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p>We regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary to ensure that your personal information is protected. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:security@logto.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security@logto.io</a>.</p>

<p>At Logto Cloud, we take the security and privacy of your personal information seriously. We have implemented various security measures to protect your data, as outlined in our <a href="/terms/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. Some of the key security practices we follow include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secure Communication</strong>: All communication between you and our Logto services is enforced by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLS</a> (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that all data transmitted between your device and our service is encrypted and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Private Database Network</strong>: The Logto database resides in a private network within the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#choose-your-region" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure West Europe region</a> and has no direct access to the public internet. This setup ensures that your data is stored in a secure and protected environment.</li>
<li><strong>Data Isolation</strong>: Each tenant has a dedicated database role, and we enforce <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-rowsecurity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Row-Level Security</a> to ensure that your data is isolated within the database. This means that only authorized users have access to the data, and each tenant&#x27;s data is completely separated from that of other tenants.</li>
<li><strong>Password Encryption</strong>: We prioritize the security of your passwords. Logto does not store passwords in plain text. Instead, all passwords are encrypted using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argon2</a> algorithm, a secure password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even in the event of a data breach, your password remains protected and uncompromised.</li>
<li><strong>Database Encryption</strong>: For an added layer of security, all data stored in the Logto database is encrypted at rest, ensuring that your sensitive information remains safe and protected. You can find more details about our database encryption in the section on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-security#information-protection-and-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information protection and encryption</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We regularly review and update our security practices to ensure that your personal information is safeguarded at all times. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of your personal information, please feel free to contact our security team at <a href="mailto:security@logto.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security@logto.io</a>.</p>
