1. Provide an `App integration name`. It will be used as the identifier of your OIDC application.
2. Add a new `Sign-in redirect URIs` using the Logto SSO connector's callback URL.

This is the URI that the Okta will redirect the user's browser after successful authentication. After a user successfully authenticates with the IdP, the IdP redirects the user's browser back to this designated URI along with an authorization code. Logto will complete the authentication process based on the authorization code received from this URI.

3. Assign users to the application.

Based on the `Assignments` settings, you can choose to assign the application to all users or specific users/groups.
