# Set up social login with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

The official Logto connector for OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

<GuideTip />

## Get started \{#get-started}

The OIDC connector enables Logto's connection to an arbitrary social identity provider that supports OIDC protocol. Use the OIDC connector to let your application:

- Add social sign-in buttons
- Link user accounts to social identities
- Sync user profile info from the social provider
- Access third-party APIs through secure token storage in Logto Secret Vault for automation tasks (e.g., editing Google Docs, managing Calendar events in your app)

To set up these authentication features, create an OIDC connector in Logto first:

1. Go to <CloudLink to="/connectors/social">Logto console > Connector > Social connector</CloudLink>.
2. Click **Add social connector**, select **OIDC**, click **Next**, and follow the step-by-step tutorial to complete the integration.

:::note

OIDC connector is a special kind of connector in Logto, you can add multiple OIDC-protocol-based connectors.
