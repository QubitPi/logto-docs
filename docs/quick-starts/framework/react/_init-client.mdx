Import and use `LogtoProvider` to provide a Logto context to your app:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { LogtoProvider, LogtoConfig } from '@logto/react';

const config: LogtoConfig = {
  endpoint: '<your-logto-endpoint>', // E.g. http://localhost:3001
  appId: '<your-application-id>',
};

const App = () => (
  <LogtoProvider config={config}>
    <YourAppContent />
  </LogtoProvider>
);
```

:::caution[`LogtoProvider` implicitly re-renders contained component]

React has a powerful composition model. The `LogtoProvider` uses _containment_ to reuse code between components.

Some components don't know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like `LogtoProvider`
that represent generic OAuth2 flows. Such components use the special `children` prop to pass children elements directly
into part of their rendering:

```tsx
const LogtoProvider = ({ config, LogtoClientClass = LogtoClient, children, unstable_enableCache = false, }) => {
  ...

  return jsx(LogtoContext.Provider, { value: memorizedContextValue, children: children });
};
```

This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:

```tsx
<LogtoProvider config={config}>
  <YourAppContent />
</LogtoProvider>
```

Anything inside the `<LogtoProvider>` JSX tag gets passed into the `LogtoProvider` component as a `children` prop.

By composition, the children takes advantage of
[Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) by delegating the OAuth2 flows to logto
library. The tricky part, however, is that the transparency of logto gets polluted into React business logics. For
example, the `<LogtoProvider>` has a [side effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>) of

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const isAuthenticated = await memorizedLogtoClient.logtoClient.isAuthenticated();
    setIsAuthenticated(isAuthenticated);
    setLoadingCount((count) => Math.max(0, count - 1));
  })();
}, [memorizedLogtoClient]);
```

Since the async operation invokes `setIsAuthenticated`, any client-side logic of

```tsx
const { isAuthenticated } = useLogto();
```

will **trigger a component re-rendering** and in fact, since LogtoContext always
[initializes `isAuthenticated` to `false`](https://github.com/logto-io/js/blob/957a1c92e5c24764f343fbc1fbb0284afb9617c4/packages/react/src/context.tsx#L43),
executing the OAuth2 flow on our app **will almost always trigger the component re-rendering at least once**
