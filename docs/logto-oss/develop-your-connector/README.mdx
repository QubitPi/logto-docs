# Develop your connector

Currently, Logto has provided many widely used social sign-in connectors such as WeChat, Alipay, Google, Facebook, etc., and SMS/Email connectors such as AliCloud, SendGrid, and Twilio.

Here is an architecture diagram illustrating how connectors work with Logto core service.

While we're working on more connectors, you can also develop your connectors. You are encouraged to share your connectors with the whole community.
