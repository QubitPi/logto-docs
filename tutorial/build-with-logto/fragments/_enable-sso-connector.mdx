You donâ€™t need to configure enterprise connectors individually, Logto simplifies SSO integration into your applications with just one click.

1. Navigate to: [Console > Sign-in experience > Sign-up and sign-in](https://cloud.logto.io/to/sign-in-experience/sign-up-and-sign-in).
2. Enable the "Enterprise SSO" toggle.
3. Save changes.

Once enabled, a "Single Sign-On" button will appear on your sign-in page. Enterprise users with SSO-enabled email domains can access your services using their enterprise identity providers (IdPs).
